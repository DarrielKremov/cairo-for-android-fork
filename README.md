cairo-for-android-fork
======================

Credits to https://github.com/anoek/android-cairo for essentially all of this port, some slight modifications made to make building easier. Intended to be used for easy compiling of Cairo for Android, using the Android NDK. 

To compile, just run the following from the cairo-for-android directory:
"[path-to-NDK]\ndk-build"

The libs\armeabi folder will contain "libcairo-android.so"
